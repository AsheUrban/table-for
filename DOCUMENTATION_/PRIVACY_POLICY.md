## What This App Does

Dine Together is a social restaurant discovery app. You create an account, share restaurant posts, save places, and explore dining recommendations from other users.

## What We Collect

**Account information:** Email address, username, and profile bio fields you provide during signup and profile setup.

**Posts and saved places:** The restaurant posts you create (captions, place references) and the places you save to your profile.

**Restaurant data:** When you search or select a restaurant, we store place details from the Google Places API (name, address, rating, photos) in our database so posts and place profiles load reliably.

**Authentication data:** Firebase Authentication manages your login session. This includes your email and a unique user ID.

## Where Your Data Lives

Your data is stored in Google Cloud Firestore through Firebase, hosted on Google's infrastructure. Authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication. Restaurant data is fetched from the Google Places API and cached in Firestore.

## What We Don't Do

- We don't sell your data to anyone.
- We don't serve ads or share data with advertisers.
- We don't track you across other apps or websites.
- We don't collect your location unless you explicitly use the geolocation feature in Explore, and that data is only used for the search query — it's not stored.

## Third-Party Services

- **Firebase (Google):** Authentication and database. Subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Google Places API:** Restaurant search and details. Subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

We don't use analytics services, crash reporters, or any other third-party tracking tools.
